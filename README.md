# OpenCV with Python
## Important Updates:
`caer.train_val_split()` is a deprecated feature in [`caer`](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/). Use `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split()` instead.

## 1. Installation
Besides installing OpenCV, we cover the installation of the following package:

[**`Caer`**](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/) is a *lightweight, high-performance* Vision library for high-performance AI research. It simplifies your approach towards Computer Vision by abstracting away unnecessary boilerplate code giving you the **flexibility** to quickly prototype deep learning models and research ideas. 
```bash
$ pip install caer
```
